# BMI Calculator using LangGraph

This project demonstrates a simple BMI (Body Mass Index) calculator built using LangGraph.

## 🧠 Overview

The workflow:
- Uses TypedDict for state management
- Implements a StateGraph
- Calculates BMI using:

   BMI = weight / (height^2)

- Returns updated state with computed BMI
- Also it states is you are Underweight, Overweight or Fit based on your calculated BMI
